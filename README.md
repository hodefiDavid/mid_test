# ALU Module Specification

## Module Description

The ALU module implements an Arithmetic Logic Unit that performs various arithmetic and logical operations on binary data. It takes several inputs and provides one output.

### Inputs:
- **A, B**: Operands (typically of the same width) for the operation.
- **MODE**: A control signal that specifies the desired operation.

### Output:
- **result - Y**: The output of the operation performed based on the opcode and operands.

## Supported Operations (Example)

```python
0: Y = a + b;
1: Y = a - b;
2: Y = ++a;
3: Y = b;
```

### Comparison (Optional)

Functional Specification:

- The behavior of the ALU is determined by the combination of the MODE and the operands (a and b).
- The MODE should be encoded with a specific number of bits to represent different operations.
- Each operation has a defined behavior on the result output based on the operands. Refer to the specific operation definition for details.
- The module may handle undefined or invalid opcode values in a specific way (e.g., setting result to a constant value).

## Constraints

- The width of a, b, and result should be consistent based on the intended operations.
- The encoding of the opcode should be clearly defined.
- The module should operate correctly within a specified clock cycle or latency.

### Combinational Logic

- The ALU primarily implements combinational logic based on the opcode and operands to determine the result.

#### Error Handling (Optional)

- The module can optionally handle undefined or invalid opcode values by setting the result to a specific error code or using a dedicated error signal.

##### Formal Properties (Optional)

- Formal verification techniques can be used to write properties that ensure the ALU performs operations correctly based on the opcode and operands. These properties can verify various aspects like addition, subtraction, and logical operations.

This specification provides a starting point for documenting the ALU module. Additional details can be included based on your specific implementation, such as:

- Specific definition of supported operations and their behavior on the result output.
- Encoding scheme for the opcode signal.
- Timing requirements for inputs and outputs.
- Error handling strategy for invalid opcode values (if applicable).
- Test strategy and coverage requirements.
